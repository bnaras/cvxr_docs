<h2>Warning</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The solution described below is useful when you mathematically know
a problem is DCP-compliant and none of your data inputs will change
the nature of the problem. We recommend that users check the
DCP-compliance of a problem (via a call to <code>is_dcp(prob)</code> for
example) at least once to ensure this is the case. <em>Not verifying
DCP-compliance may result in garbage!</em></p></li>
<li><p>Note also that the large speed gains in previous versions are no longer
evident in the version 1.x because the new reduction framework has
really made <code>CVXR</code> faster.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As was remarked in the <a href="../../cvxr_examples/intro/">introduction to
<code>CVXR</code></a>, its chief advantage is
<em>flexibility</em>: you can specify a problem in close to mathematical form
and <code>CVXR</code> solves it for you, if it can. Behind the scenes, <code>CVXR</code>
compiles the domain specific language and verifies the convexity of
the problem before sending it off to solvers. If the problem violates
the rules of <a href="../../post/cvxr_dcp/">Disciplined Convex Programming</a> it is
rejected.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is generally slower than tailor-made solutions to a
given problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-example" class="section level2">
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>To understand the speed issues, let us consider the global warming
data from the <a href="http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/trends/temp/jonescru/">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
(CDIAC)</a>
again. The data points are the annual temperature anomalies relative
to the 1961â€“1990 mean. We will fit the nearly-isotonic approximation
<span class="math inline">\(\beta \in {\mathbf R}^m\)</span> by solving</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\underset{\beta}{\mbox{Minimize}} &amp; \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^m (y_i - \beta_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{m-1}(\beta_i - \beta_{i+1})_+,
\end{array}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \geq 0\)</span> is a penalty parameter and <span class="math inline">\(x_+ =\max(x,0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This can be solved as follows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(CVXR)))
data(cdiac)
y &lt;- cdiac$annual
m &lt;- length(y)
lambda &lt;- 0.44
beta &lt;- Variable(m)
obj &lt;- 0.5 * sum((y - beta)^2) + lambda * sum(pos(diff(beta)))
prob &lt;- Problem(Minimize(obj))
soln &lt;- solve(prob, solver = &quot;ECOS&quot;)
betaHat &lt;- soln$getValue(beta)</code></pre>
<p>This is the <em>recommended way</em> to solve a problem.</p>
<p>However, suppose we wished to construct bootstrap confidence intervals
for the estimate using 100 resamples. It is clear that this
computation time can quickly become limiting .</p>
<p>Below, we show how one can get at the problem data and directly call a
solver to get faster results.</p>
</div>
<div id="profile-the-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Profile the code</h2>
<p>Profiling a single fit to the model is useful to figure out where most
of the time is spent.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(profvis)
y &lt;- cdiac$annual

<p>It is especially instructive to click on the <em>data</em> tab and open up
the tree for <code>solve</code> to see the sequence of calls and cumulative time
used.</p>
<p>The profile shows that most of the total time (2400ms for one of our
runs) time is spent in the call to <code>is_dcp</code> generic (about
2000ms). This generic is responsible to ensuring that all the problem
is DCP-compliant by checking the nature of each of the components that
make up the problem. The actual solving took a <em>much smaller</em> fraction
of the time.</p>
</div>
<div id="directly-calling-the-solver" class="section level2">
<h2>Directly Calling the Solver</h2>
<p>We are mathematically certain that the above is convex and so we can
avoid the <code>is_dcp</code> hit. We can obtain the the problem data for a
particular solver (like <code>OSQP</code>, or <code>ECOS</code> or <code>SCS</code>) using the function
<code>get_problem_data</code> and directly hand that data to the solver to get
the solution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prob_data &lt;- get_problem_data(prob, solver = &quot;ECOS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><em>ASIDE</em>: How did we know ECOS was the solver to use? Future versions
will provide a function to match a solver to a problem. (Actually, it
is available already, but not exported yet!). For now, a single call
to <code>solve</code> with the verbose option set to <code>TRUE</code> can provide that
information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>soln &lt;- solve(prob, verbose = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the problem data and know which solver to use, we can
call the ECOS solver with the right arguments. (The ECOS solver is
provided by the package <code>ECOSolveR</code>, which <code>CVXR</code> imports.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (packageVersion(&quot;CVXR&quot;) &gt; &quot;0.99-7&quot;) {
    ECOS_dims &lt;- ECOS.dims_to_solver_dict(prob_data$data[[&quot;dims&quot;]])
} else {
    ECOS_dims &lt;- prob_data$data[[&quot;dims&quot;]]
}
solver_output &lt;- ECOSolveR::ECOS_csolve(c = prob_data$data[[&quot;c&quot;]],
                                        G = prob_data$data[[&quot;G&quot;]],
                                        h = prob_data$data[[&quot;h&quot;]],
                                        dims = ECOS_dims,

                                        b = prob_data$data[[&quot;b&quot;]])</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can obtain the results by asking <code>CVXR</code> to <em>unpack</em> the
solver results for us. (See <code>?unpack_results</code> for further examples.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (packageVersion(&quot;CVXR&quot;) &gt; &quot;0.99-7&quot;) {
