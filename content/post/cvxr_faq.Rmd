## Answers

1. <a name="gen-help"></a>Where can I go for help?

Please post questions to the `cvx` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cvx).

2. <a name="dcp-help"></a>My problem is not DCP compliant. How do I reformulate it?

It is impossible for us to analyze every individual problem and determine whether it can be reformulated as a DCP problem.
Your best bet is to go through the examples in the @BoydVandenberghe:2004 book and its [additional exercises](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).

3. <a name="bug"></a>I want to report a bug.

Please open an issue on the [CVXR Github
Issues](https://github.com/anqif/CVXR/issues) page with a
reproducible example.
