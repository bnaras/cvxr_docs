	abstract = {This paper provides a novel mechanism for identifying and estimating latent group structures in panel data using penalized techniques. We consider both linear and nonlinear models where the regression coefficients are heterogeneous across groups but homogeneous within a group and the group membership is unknown. Two approaches are considered‚Äîpenalized profile likelihood (PPL) estimation for the general nonlinear models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) estimation for linear models with endogeneity. In both cases, we develop a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PPL estimation, C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM estimation, the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the approach in both classification and estimation. Empirical applications to both linear and nonlinear models are presented.}

The main element of the calibration process is an optimization procedure, for which a variety of penalty functions can be used. In this chapter, we consider three of the classical penalty functions that are implemented in many of the standard calibration software packages. We present two algorithms used by many of these software packages, and explore the properties of the calibrated weights and the corresponding estimates when using these two algorithms with the classical calibration penalty functions.},
