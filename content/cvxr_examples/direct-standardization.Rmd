## Introduction

Consider a set of observations $(x_i,y_i)$ drawn non-uniformly from an
unknown distribution. We know the expected value of the columns of
$X$, denoted by $b \in {\mathbf R}^n$, and want to estimate the true
distribution of $y$. This situation may arise, for instance, if we
wish to analyze the health of a population based on a sample skewed
toward young males, knowing the average population-level sex, age,
etc. The empirical distribution that places equal probability
$1/m$ on each $y_i$ is not a good estimate. 

So, we must determine the weights $w \in {\mathbf R}^m$ of a weighted
empirical distribution, $y = y_i$ with probability $w_i$, which
rectifies the skewness of the sample [@dirstd, 19.5]. We can pose this
problem as

$$
	\begin{array}{ll} \underset{w}{\mbox{maximize}} & \sum_{i=1}^m -w_i\log w_i \\
	\mbox{subject to} & w \geq 0, \quad \sum_{i=1}^m w_i = 1,\quad X^Tw = b.
	\end{array}
$$

Our objective is the total entropy, which is concave on ${\mathbf
R}_+^m$, and our constraints ensure $w$ is a probability distribution
that implies our known expectations on $X$. 

To illustrate this method, we generate $m = 1000$ data points
$x_{i,1} \sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(0.5)$,
$x_{i,2} \sim \mbox{Uniform}(10,60)$, and
$y_i \sim N(5x_{i,1} + 0.1x_{i,2},1)$. Then we construct a skewed
sample of $m = 100$ points that overrepresent small values of $y_i$,
thus biasing its distribution downwards. This can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:direct-std}, where the sample probability distribution peaks
around $y = 2.0$, and its cumulative distribution is shifted left from
the population's curve. Using direct standardization, we estimate
$w_i$ and reweight our sample; the new empirical distribution cleaves
much closer to the true distribution shown in red.

In the `CVXR` code below, we import data from the package and solve
for $w$.

```{r}
suppressWarnings(library(CVXR, warn.conflicts=FALSE))

## Import problem data
data(dspop)   # Population
data(dssamp)  # Skewed sample

ypop <- dspop[,1]
Xpop <- dspop[,-1]
y <- dssamp[,1]
X <- dssamp[,-1]
m <- nrow(X)

## Given population mean of features
b <- as.matrix(apply(Xpop, 2, mean))

## Construct the direct standardization problem
w <- Variable(m)
objective <- sum(entr(w))
constraints <- list(w >= 0, sum(w) == 1, t(X) %*% w == b)
prob <- Problem(Maximize(objective), constraints)

## Solve for the distribution weights
result <- solve(prob)
weights <- result$getValue(w)
result$value
```

We can plot the density functions using linear approximations for the
range of $y$. 

```{r, fig.cap = "Probability distribution functions population, skewed sample and reweighted sample"}

library(ggplot2)
## Plot probability density functions
dens1 <- density(ypop)
dens2 <- density(y)
dens3 <- density(y, weights = weights)
yrange <- seq(-3, 15, 0.01)
d <- data.frame(x = yrange,
                True = approx(x = dens1$x, y = dens1$y, xout = yrange)$y,
                Sample = approx(x = dens2$x, y = dens2$y, xout = yrange)$y,
                Weighted = approx(x = dens3$x, y = dens3$y, xout = yrange)$y)
library(tidyr)
plot.data <- gather(data = d, key = "Type", value = "Estimate", True, Sample, Weighted,
                    factor_key = TRUE)
ggplot(plot.data) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = x, y = Estimate, color = Type)) +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Followed by the cumulative distribution function.

```{r}
## Return the cumulative distribution function
get_cdf <- function(data, probs, color = 'k') {
    if(missing(probs))
        probs <- rep(1.0/length(data), length(data))
    distro <- cbind(data, probs)
    dsort <- distro[order(distro[,1]),]
    ecdf <- base::cumsum(dsort[,2])
    cbind(dsort[,1], ecdf)
}

## Plot cumulative distribution functions
d1 <- data.frame("True", get_cdf(ypop))
d2 <- data.frame("Sample", get_cdf(y))
d3 <- data.frame("Weighted", get_cdf(y, weights))

names(d1) <- names(d2) <- names(d3) <- c("Type", "x", "Estimate")
plot.data <- rbind(d1, d2, d3)

ggplot(plot.data) +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = x, y = Estimate, color = Type)) +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
