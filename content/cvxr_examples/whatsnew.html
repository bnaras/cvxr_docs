<p><code>CVXR</code> 1.0 includes a major rewrite of the <code>CVXR</code> internals, as well
as a number of changes to the user interface. The goal is to follow
<code>cvxpy</code> as much as possible. We first give an overview of the changes,
before diving into the details. We only cover changes that might be of
interest to users.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Disciplined geometric programming (DGP): Starting with version 1.0.11, <code>CVXR</code> lets you formulate and solve log-log convex programs, which generalize both traditional geometric programs and generalized geometric programs. To get started with DGP, check out the tutorial and consult the accompanying paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Reductions: <code>CVXR</code> 1.0 uses a modular system of reductions to convert problems input by the user into the format required by the solver, which makes it easy to support new standard forms, such as quadratic programs, and more advanced user inputs, such as problems with complex variables. See Reductions and the accompanying paper for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributes: Variables and parameters now support a variety of attributes that describe their symbolic properties, such as nonnegative or symmetric. This unifies the treatment of symbolic properties for variables and parameters and replaces specialized variable classes such as Bool and Semidef.</p></li>
<li><p>Transforms: The new transform class provides additional ways of manipulating <code>CVXR</code> objects, byond the atomic functions. While atomic functions operate only on expressions, transforms may also take Problem, Objective, or Constraint objects as input.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="reductions" class="section level2">
<h2>Reductions</h2>
<p>A reduction is a transformation from one problem to an equivalent problem. Two problems are equivalent if a solution of one can be converted to a solution of the other with no more than a moderate amount of effort. <code>CVXR</code> uses reductions to rewrite problems into forms that solvers will accept. The practical benefit of the reduction based framework is that <code>CVXR</code> 1.0 supports quadratic programs as a target solver standard form in addition to cone programs, with more standard forms on the way. It also makes it easy to add generic problem transformations such as converting problems with complex variables into problems with only real variables.
Attributes</p>
<p>Attributes describe the symbolic properties of variables and parameters and are specified as arguments to the constructor. For example, Variable(nonneg=TRUE) creates a scalar variable constrained to be nonnegative. Attributes replace the previous syntax of special variable classes like Bool for boolean variables and Semidef for symmetric positive semidefinite variables, as well as specification of the sign for parameters (e.g., Parameter(sign=‘positive’)). Concretely, write</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Variable(shape, boolean=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Bool(shape)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Variable(shape, integer=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Int(shape)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Variable(c(n, n), PSD=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Semidef(n)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Variable(c(n, n), symmetric=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Symmetric(n)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Variable(shape, nonneg=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>NonNegative(shape)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Parameter(shape, nonneg=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Parameter(shape, sign='positive')</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Parameter(shape, nonpos=TRUE)</code> instead of <code>Parameter(shape, sign='negative')</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See Attributes for a complete list of supported attributes. More attributes will be added in the future.

<div id="transforms" class="section level2">
<h2>Transforms</h2>
<p>Transforms provide additional ways of manipulating <code>CVXR</code> objects beyond the atomic functions. For example, the indicator transform converts a list of constraints into an expression representing the convex function that takes value 0 when the constraints hold and ∞
when they are violated. See Transforms for a full list of the new transforms.</p>
