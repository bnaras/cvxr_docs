## Introduction

In classification problems, the goal is to predict the class
membership based on predictors. Often there are two classes and one of
the most popular methods for binary classification is logistic
regression [@Cox:1958, @Freedman:2009].  

Suppose now that $y_i \in \{0,1\}$ is a binary class indicator. The
conditional response is modeled as $y|x \sim
\mbox{Bernoulli}(g_{\beta}(x))$, where $g_{\beta}(x) = \frac{1}{1 +
e^{-x^T\beta}}$ is the logistic function, and maximize the
log-likelihood function, yielding the optimization problem

\[
\begin{array}{ll} 
\underset{\beta}{\mbox{maximize}} & \sum_{i=1}^m \{
y_i\log(g_{\beta}(x_i)) + (1-y_i)\log(1 - g_{\beta}(x_i)) \}.
\end{array} 
\]

`CVXR` provides the `logistic` atom as a shortcut for $f(z) =
\log(1 + e^z)$ to express the optimization problem.  One may be
tempted to use `log(1 + exp(X %*% beta))` as in conventional
`R` syntax. However, this representation of $f(z)$ violates
the DCP composition rule, so the `CVXR` parser will reject the
problem even though the objective is convex. Users who wish to employ
a function that is convex, but not DCP compliant should check the
documentation for a custom atom or consider a different formulation.

## Example

The formulation is very similar to OLS, except for the specification
of the objective. 

In the example below, we demonstrate a _key feature_ of `CVXR`, that
of evaluating various functions of the variables that are solutions to
the optimization problem. For instance, the log-odds, $X\hat{\beta}$,
where $\hat{\beta}$ is the logistic regression estimate, is simply
specified as `X %*% beta` below, and the `getValue` function of the
result will compute its value.  (Any other function of the estimate
can be similarly computed.)

```{r}
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(CVXR)))
n <- 20
m <- 1000
offset <- 0
sigma <- 45
DENSITY <- 0.2

set.seed(183991)
beta_true <- stats::rnorm(n)
idxs <- sample(n, size = floor((1-DENSITY)*n), replace = FALSE)
beta_true[idxs] <- 0
X <- matrix(stats::rnorm(m*n, 0, 5), nrow = m, ncol = n)
y <- sign(X %*% beta_true + offset + stats::rnorm(m, 0, sigma))

beta <- Variable(n)
obj <- -sum(logistic(-X[y <= 0, ] %*% beta)) - sum(logistic(X[y == 1, ] %*% beta))
prob <- Problem(Maximize(obj))
result <- solve(prob)

log_odds <- result$getValue(X %*% beta)
beta_res <- result$getValue(beta)
y_probs <- 1/(1 + exp(-X %*% beta_res))
```

We can compare with the standard `stats::glm` estimate.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(y = as.numeric(y > 0), X = X)
glm <- stats::glm(formula = y ~ 0 + X, family = "binomial", data = d)
est.table <- data.frame("CVXR.est" = beta_res, "GLM.est" = coef(glm))
rownames(est.table) <- paste0("$\\beta_{", 1:n, "}$")
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(est.table, format = "html") %>%
    kable_styling("striped") %>%
    column_spec(1:3, background = "#ececec")
```

The sign difference is due to the coding of $y$ as $(-1, 1)$ for
`CVXR` rather than $(0, 1)$ for `stats::glm`. 

So, for completeness, if we were to code the $y$ as $(0, 1)$, the
objective will have to be modified as below. 


```{r}
obj <- -sum(X[y <= 0, ] %*% beta) - sum(logistic(-X %*% beta))
prob <- Problem(Maximize(obj))
result <- solve(prob)
beta_log <- result$getValue(beta)
est.table <- data.frame("CVXR.est" = beta_log, "GLM.est" = coef(glm))
rownames(est.table) <- paste0("$\\beta_{", 1:n, "}$")
knitr::kable(est.table, format = "html") %>%
    kable_styling("striped") %>%
    column_spec(1:3, background = "#ececec")
```

Now, the results match perfectly.
